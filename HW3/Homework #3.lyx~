A PSM has several many advantages over a rule-based system:

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
They can account for partially random outcomes or decisions that are not
 under the control fo the decision maker.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They can provide multiple different solutions to a single problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
They are able to “learn” by updating probabilities.

\begin_layout Standard
we've decided that the skeletal plan refinement is the PSM that best describes
 how we get dressed in the morning.
 According to the paper, a skeletal plan is a sequence of generalized steps,
 which, when instantiated by specific operations in a specific problem context,
 will solve a given problem.
 In the case of getting dressed in the morning, we follow a sequence of
 general steps to put the clothes on, and these steps instantiated in a
 context determines our choice of clothing.

What is the difference between a classification method and a constructive
 method? Give an example of how a diagnostic task can be solved by either
 method.
 You may use examples from class.
 In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifyin
g to which of a set of categories a new observation belongs on the basis
 of a training set of data containing observations.
 A constructive method is a method in which a new contribution is developed,
 the contribution being a new theory, algorithm, model, software, or framework

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A diagnostic task can be solved by either method, in a classification method,
 observations would have to be gathered and input into a learning model.
 This model can make new predictions based on the observations.
 In a constructive method, a researcher would construct a way to solve the
 task and ask the computer to execute.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Problem 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The initial values of the puzzle are the squares that already have numbers
 written in them, we'll call these our seeds.
 The constraints of the puzzle are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 regions have to contain only numbers unique from 1 to 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each row has to have only unique numbers from 1 to 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each column has to have only unique numbers from 1 to 4.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All the squares of the puzzle must be filled in and constraints 
\series bold
a
\series default
, 
\series bold
b 
\series default
and 
\series bold
c
\series default
 must be met for the puzzle to be considered solved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to solve this puzzle using the propose and revise method, we can
 start at the top right square of the puzzle.
 If the square is empty, we insert a 1.
 The we check that our constraints are met.
 If any of the constraints are violated, we remove the 1 and and insert
 the next number in the sequence.
 Again, we check if the entry violates the constraints.
 If it doesn't we mark it as a 
\begin_inset Formula $decision\ point$
\end_inset

 and proceed to the next blank square and apply the same algorithm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If at any during the process we run into a conflict on the puzzle we go
 back to our previous decision point and try a different solution that does
 not violate our constraints.
 In this way, we backtrack throuh all the point we made a decision and propose
 a different solution to a square until the entire puzzle is solved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In order to describe sudoku as a search problem, we need to define the 
\series bold
goal state
\series default
.
 In this case the goal state is a state where all the constraints of the
 sudoku puzzle(listed in part a) are satisfied.
 If we model the puzzle as a graph search, the nodes will be the states
 that the puzzle possible state that the puzzle can have and the edges would
 be the entry that got us to that state.
 We then start from the initial state and try every digit as a solution
 to the puzzle.
 If we get to a state where the constraints are violated, we mark that particula
r path as bad and we backtrack to the last known good state.
 We then take a different edge from that state and continue solving.
 We stop when we get to a node that represents the goal state.
 If no such node exists, we report that the puzzle has no solution.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Problem 3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Sensitivity is called the true positive rate and measures the proportion
 of actual positives which are correctly identified (the percentage of sick
 people who were correctly identified as having the condition).
 Specificity is called the true negative rate and measures the proportion
 of negatives which were correctly identified (the percentage of healthy
 people who were correctly identified as not having the condition).
 Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity.
 Thus, if a researcher finds much more variability in specificity than sensitivi
ty, this means that the researcher has found more variability in the true
 negative rate than the true positive rate.
 This means that radiologists are more consistently detecting cancers, but
 are more sporadic in identifying healthy people as having or not having
 cancer.
 From a practical standpoint, this means that for cancer, radiologists are
 conservative and are more comfortable with false positives (say a healthy
 person has cancer) than false negatives (say a cancerous person is healthy).

\begin_inset Formula $Specificity=\frac{TrueNegative}{TrueNegative+FalsePositive}=\frac{CorrectlyDiagmosedHealthyPeople}{AllHealthyPeople}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is unlikely that there would be more variability in specificity than
 sensitivity when detecting cancer, because the denominator for specificity
 is so much larger than the denominator for sensitivity.
 Because radiologists are generally conservative, they would lean towards
 having false positive > false negative.
 Thus, the denominator for specificty would be larger.
 In addition, since there are generally more healthy people than people
 with cancer, the true negative count will be greater than the true positive
 cancer, thus again, the denominator for specificty will be greater.
 When the denominator is greater, it is harder to see lots of variability.

The positive predicted value (PPV) is defined as: 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{TruePositives}{TruePositives+FalsePositives}=\frac{TruePositives}{AllPositives}$

\begin_layout Standard
This means that radiologists are evaluated essentially on what percentage
 of people they say have cancer actually in fact have cancer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps radiologists are trained to be conservative, their false negative
 count is probably very low.
 Thus, evaluating them by sensitivity/specificty thus would not be a good
 metric in order to distinguish radiologists.
 Instead, radiologists are evaluated by what percetage of all

 patients actually end up having cancer.

\begin_layout Enumerate
If my mother is going to get her yearly mammogram, I would recommend a radiologi
st with high sensitivity.
 This means that he/she has a very high percentage of correctly diagnosing
 someone with cancer out of all the people who have cancer.
 I would rather the radiologist be conservative and trigger on low-risk
 signs (low specificity) in order to reduce the risk of missing a case when
 cancer is actually present (high sensitivity).
